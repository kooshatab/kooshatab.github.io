I’m Koosha Tabesh, a Structural Design Engineer with over a decade of experience in construction management and structural engineering. I specialize in designing and analyzing reinforced concrete and steel structures, with expertise in structural modeling, seismic design, and performance-based engineering. My work is grounded in a strong command of international and domestic codes, and I’m passionate about delivering sustainable, innovative solutions for complex infrastructure and building projects.
My academic journey includes a B.S. in Civil Engineering from Isfahan University of Technology (2006), an M.S. in Construction Management from the Technical University of Munich (2011), and an M.S. in Structural Engineering from the University of Southern California (2024). I also hold PMP certification and actively contribute to the engineering community as a member of ASCE. Beyond my professional work, I’ve volunteered since 2014 as a math and physics instructor for an online charity school in Iran, promoting STEM education for underserved students.
I’m driven by a commitment to technical excellence, collaboration, and continuous learning—always seeking opportunities to apply advanced design methodologies and make a positive impact.. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
